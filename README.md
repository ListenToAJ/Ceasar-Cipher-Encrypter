# Ceasar Cipher Encrypter :lock:

Lightweight Python script to encrypt text.

## Description

This small and simply Python script encrypts text input files via the command line by shifting the letters to a specified shift distance.  Originally made because my girlfriend is nosy and tries to spoil her gifts, so I wanted to encrypt her christmas gift list.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python3

### Installing

* This script is run through the command line, so it will probably be most convient if placed in the same folder as the text file you are encrypting, but idk i'm not your dad.

### Executing program

* The first argument passed is the file, the second is the shift distance
```
Python3 cipher.py input_file.txt -3
```
